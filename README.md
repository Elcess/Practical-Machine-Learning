The multiplot() function comes from *Cookbook for R* by Winston Chang.

## Repository Contents

The complete code for producing the model and outputs is contained in PMLProject.Rmd. It was rendered for Peer Review ***before*** the predictions on the test samples were made, so as not to contaminate the output. Almost everything was echoed into the HTML document. I only turned echo off for the 2-column plot; you need the .Rmd file to see the code for making it.

PMLProject.md and PMLProject.html were created by running knitr on the .Rmd file. Including code, the HTML document is just under 2000 words, according to Word's word counter. (There may be some oddness due to inclusion of R code in those "words.")
