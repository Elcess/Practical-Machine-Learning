## Repository Contents

The complete code for producing the model and outputs is contained in PMLProject.Rmd. It was rendered for Peer Review **before** the predictions on the test samples were made, so as not to contaminate the output. Note that I set "echo=FALSE" as default for this file, so the HTML document will not show all the code; you need the .Rmd file to see it.

PMLProject.md and PMLProject.html were created by running knitr on the .Rmd file.
